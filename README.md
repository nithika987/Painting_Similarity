**Dataset**
Dataset: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/NationalGalleryOfArt/opendata&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1743430855089832&usg=AOvVaw2YqeNkDKXA4Gfs70IqK9F0

1Ô∏è‚É£ Optimized Image Loading ‚Äì The OptimizedImageDataset class ensures efficient image loading, with optional augmentations (flips, rotations, color jittering) for robustness.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling & Data Integrity ‚Äì Handles missing or corrupt images gracefully by returning a zero tensor, preventing training crashes.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Image Downloading ‚Äì The ImageDownloader class fetches painting images from the National Gallery of Art Open Data, with CSV validation and metadata filtering.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Parallelized Image Processing ‚Äì Uses multi-threaded parallel downloads (16 jobs at once) for fast and scalable image retrieval.
5Ô∏è‚É£ FAISS-Compatible Image Storage ‚Äì Ensures images are stored in a structured format, enabling efficient similarity searches using FAISS indexing.
**Model**
https://github.com/nithika987/Painting_Similarity/blob/main/models/hybrid_face_similarity.py
Triple-Powered Embeddings:
‚úî ArcFace (Identity-Based) ‚Äì Extracts high-precision facial embeddings, ensuring identity-level similarity for face verification.
‚úî DINOv2 (High-Level Semantics) ‚Äì Captures deep, abstract patterns, making it perfect for matching paintings and artistic styles beyond just pixel similarity.
‚úî CLIP (Contextual Understanding) ‚Äì Bridges visual and textual similarity, enabling text-based image retrieval (e.g., "Find a portrait that looks like Van Gogh's style").

Painting & Face Similarity:
    Painting Matching ‚Äì Unlike traditional feature extractors, DINOv2 understands texture, brushstrokes, and artistic styles, making it perfect for finding visually similar paintings.
    Face Similarity ‚Äì ArcFace ensures accurate identity-level matching, while DINOv2 helps find lookalikes even with different lighting, angles, or artistic distortions.

üîπ Superior Image Preprocessing for Maximum Accuracy in Paintings:
     Color & Contrast Enhancement ‚Äì Uses Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for fine-tuned brightness and contrast correction, ensuring clearer features in paintings & low-light photos.
     Smart Sharpening ‚Äì Applies Unsharp Masking and High-Pass Filters to refine edges & textures, making face detection and painting details stand out.
     Noise Reduction & Denoising ‚Äì Removes unwanted grain while preserving fine textures, improving painting comparisons and low-light face matching.

üîπ Robust Face Detection & Extraction:
 Multi-Retry Face Detection 
 Dynamic Bounding Box Optimization 
 
üîπ Optimized for Speed & Efficiency:
 Memory-Efficient Execution 
 Fast Inference with GPU/CPU Flexibility 

 **Image Retrieval: Multi-Model Embedding Search with FAISS**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Hybrid Feature Extraction ‚Äì Uses a combination of ArcFace, DINOv2, and CLIP for superior image embeddings.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Efficient Image Indexing ‚Äì Utilizes FAISS for fast retrieval, ensuring high-speed nearest neighbor searches.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Feature Normalization ‚Äì Ensures robust and accurate similarity retrieval by normalizing embeddings.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Optimized Query Processing ‚Äì Dynamically adjusts input images with resizing, normalization, and tensor conversion for inference.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Clear Visual Results ‚Äì Displays query and similar images with distances, enhancing interpretability.
# Evaluation Metrics
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure): Evaluates perceptual similarity by considering luminance, contrast, and structure, making it ideal for assessing artistic details and textures in paintings.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures pixel-wise differences between images, helping quantify overall visual deviation in paintings.

LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity): Uses deep networks to model human visual perception, capturing complex artistic style variations beyond pixel-level comparisons.

Cosine Similarity on Embeddings: Compares feature representations of paintings, ensuring semantic and stylistic similarity detection across different artistic styles.
# Result Analysis

Average Cosine Similarity: 0.8161

The results indicate that the hybrid compression methods achieved an average cosine similarity of 0.8161, suggesting strong feature preservation. However, SSIM (~0.285), RMSE (~0.272), and LPIPS (~0.598) scores reveal moderate perceptual quality, indicating some loss in fine details.

Positives:
Consistent performance across hybrid methods.
Faces detected in many ainintgs, even miniscule faces.

Shortcomings:
Low SSIM suggests structural distortions.
Higher LPIPS indicates perceptual quality degradation.
Faces not detected in all painitngs

# Future Scope
Style Transfer & Synthesis ‚Äì Extend the system to not just find similar paintings but also generate new artworks in a given style using GANs (e.g., StyleGAN, CycleGAN).

Fine-Grained Artist Attribution ‚Äì Improve artist classification by incorporating hierarchical and contrastive learning techniques to distinguish subtle nuances in painting styles.

Cross-Domain Similarity Search ‚Äì Expand retrieval to historical manuscripts, sculptures, and photography, creating a unified art similarity framework beyond just paintings.
